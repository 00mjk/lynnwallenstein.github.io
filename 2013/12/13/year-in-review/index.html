It started out with me celebrating one year at <a href="http://livingsocial.com/">LivingSocial</a> in January. Working at LivingSocial was an amazing experience for me both personally and professionally. I met people there that I have learned so much from and some I have been fortunate enough to call my closest friends.</p><p>January was also an emotional whirlwind of happiness for others and sadness for me. A couple of my friends left the DC area to go move into new adventures in San Francisco and Berlin. It sort of broke up the band a little, but we used the powers of the internets to stay connected.</p><p>In March/April, I left LivingSocial for a new opportunity at <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a>. It is now December and I can&rsquo;t imagine a more amazing work environment. I am surrounded with an awesome team working on a project that I love. There is really nothing more I could ask for in a work environment. GitHub being in San Francisco also opened up a opportunity for me to travel more so it was great that I got to see my SF friends.</p><p>My sister got remarried at the end of April and I was told to expect a new niece of newphew in January (not a shotgun wedding, but close!).</p><p>Mixed in the next couple of months was more sadness with friends taking off to San Francisco (AGAIN!), but I did get to see them. I spent some time in SF onboarding some new team members and got to hang out in our new office during GitHub summit which was the first time I got to meet a lot of my coworkers face to face. I spent the summer getting settled in at work and dealing with a lot of imposter syndrome and sadness that I was sort of alone in DC.</p><p>In October I went to the <a href="http://gracehopper.org/">Grace Hopper Women in Computing Conference</a> with some of the other GitHub ladies. It is an amazing conferece, I expect to attend next year and suggest that everyone else does well&hellip; both women and men. October was a crazy busy month with hanging out in NYC for <a href=https://brooklynbeta.org/2013>Brooklyn Beta</a> (which some tasty drinks here were my undoing for the year), <a href="http://sassconf.com/">SassConf</a> and then heading to Ohio for a week of team hack housing. Wrapped up the month with the GitHub halloween party and support mini summit in SF, which has at this point become a second home.</p><p>November was pretty peaceful just hanging out in DC and taking a rest of the whirlwind that was October.</p><p>Now we are into December, my sister baby decided to make a pre-Christmas showing so I now have a newphew and am spending the rest of the year just hanging with my family and doing low key holiday stuff.</p><p>All in all, 2013 has been pretty great.</p><p>So whats next? Well DC has treated me pretty well, it is a great city, close to my family and I have a great apartment&hellip; but it is time for a change. In the next couple months I will be wrapping up things here and head to San Francisco. I am looking forward to having access to work in an office as well as hanging out with all my friends who headed west this year. I will miss the ease of seeing my family, but between quarterly trips home and google hangouts, I think the kids will see more of me then they want!</p><p>Happy holidays to everyone! <a href="http://webstore.drinkmercy.com/">Mercy up</a> before the new year!</p><footer class=post-footer><dl><dt>Tagged</dt><dd><ul class=tag-list><li><a href=/tag/blogging><span class="ss-icon ss-air">tag</span> blogging</a></li><li><a href=/tag/update><span class="ss-icon ss-air">tag</span> update</a></li></ul></dd><dt>Date Posted</dt><dd><time datetime=2013-12-13T06:40:06-08:00><span class="ss-icon ss-air">calendar</span> 13 Dec 2013</time></dd><dt>Trackback URL</dt><dd class=trackback-url><span class="ss-icon ss-air">bookmark</span><a href="http://lynn.io/2013/12/13/year-in-review/">http://lynn.io/2013/12/13/year-in-review/</a></dd></dl></footer></article><aside class=related-posts><h2>Related Posts</h2><ul><li><a href="/2013/12/22/nested-layouts-with-less-divs/">Nested Layouts with Less Divs <small>22 Dec 2013</small></a></li><li><a href="/2014/02/22/modalin/">Pure CSS Dynamic Sized Centered Modals <small>22 Feb 2014</small></a></li><li><a href="/2014/01/19/colors-matter/">Keeping Your SCSS Vars and Adobe Palletes in Sync with Tinge <small>19 Jan 2014</small></a></li></ul></aside></main><script src=//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.4/jquery.min.js></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"><\/script>')</script><script src=/js/script.374d8316.js></script><script>(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
